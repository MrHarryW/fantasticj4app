        <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em> is a comprehensive field guide documenting the magical creatures that inhabit the wizarding world. Written by magizoologist Newt Scamander and J.K. Rowling, it serves both as a textbook at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and as an authoritative reference for magical scholars.
      </p>
      <p>
        The creatures featured in this book originate from regions across the globe, and many are well-hidden from non-magical eyes. By studying these beasts, readers gain a deeper appreciation for the richness and complexity of the magical world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Newt Scamander’s work emphasizes the importance of conservation and ethical treatment of magical creatures, promoting peaceful coexistence between humans and the magical wildlife that surrounds them.
